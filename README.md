# The NewsHour - Estimating the value of Local News

## Project repository. 

This page and github repository contains `Stata` code, `Mata` code, and also documentation for some of the underlying theory, and
key references for the project. 

The project is outlined in a sequence of `IPython` notebooks which make liberal use of the [ipystata](https://github.com/TiesdeKok/ipystata)
package. This allows one to place runnable `Stata` code in a notebook block. 

### Estimation theory and methods

The notebooks for the project detailing estimation methods are:

* [News Hour Notes - Part I](NewsHourNotes - Part I.ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Part II](NewsHourNotes - Part II.ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Part III](NewsHourNotes - Part III.ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Part IV(A)](NewsHourNotes - Part IV(A).ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Part IV(B)](NewsHourNotes - Part IV(B).ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Part V](NewsHourNotes - Part V.ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Part VI](NewsHourNotes - Part VI.ipynb)

### Simulation and Post Estimation (Incomplete!)

* Presenting estimation results (to be written)
* [News Hour Notes - Post Estimation -Random Effects](NewsHourNotes - PostEstimation - Random Effects.ipynb)
* [News Hour Notes - Post Estimation - Creating Simulations](NewsHourNotes - PostEstimation - Simulations.ipynb)
* News Hour Notes - Analyzing and plotting simulations

### Discussion and ideas for extensions (To be written)
