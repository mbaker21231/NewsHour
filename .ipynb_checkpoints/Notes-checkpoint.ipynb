    "## Drawing error terms recursively\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, I am going to describe in very rough terms how to go about drawing error terms recursively so that things are consistent with the \"unilateral deviation\" story that we are using. These error terms can then be applied in just about any way possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key thing to realize is that the presence of lags make it impossible to draw these terms \"all at once\" and in fact it works best to do them backwards recursively. So, under the assumption that what everyone else is doing is fixed, we want to know - what are some plausible values for unoberved actions of a given player? What alternative viewerships and prices are consistent with the idea that our man has chosen a Nash equilibrium profile? \n",

Suppose that our station has chosen action $b_6$ in period $6$, and let $b'_6$ denote the alternative strategy available to the player (i.e., if the player chose to actually broadcast local news, the prime would represent entertainment.
