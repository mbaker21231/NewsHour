    "## Estimating the welfare impact of television news\n",

    "In our paper, which you can find [at SSRN](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2694687), we describe what turns out to be a rather complex model of television news. This model includes several features, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A viewership model with nested multinomial logit demand,\n",
    "2. A log-linear price model, \n",
    "3. Strategic interactions among stations with the aim of getting the most advertising revenues: Stations choose program menus to maximize their average nightly advertising revenues, which depend upon viewership shares and programming choices. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since there are a lot of moving parts - that we ourselves have to keep track of in details - we thought a notebook detailing various aspects of estimation would be a good idea, particularly if anyone else wanted to use some of the methods! In this first notebook, I will discuss data setup. \n",

    "# Data Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do, of course, is read in the data and render it in a manageable form. We need to revise settings and all that as well. We focus on the 2010 data, where our `sample` variable marks useable observations. We also exclude observations for which the variable `h` is not equal to twenty. This means that we are excluding observations from the twentieth hour of the day (e.g, 8 o'clock) because that is into prime time. \n"
